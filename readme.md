## 🔍 What I Really Do

I build **emotionally aware, AI-native systems** that survive real chaos.

- 5+ years in Android (Kotlin, Jetpack, Compose, Firebase)
- Architect of **Project SAM** — a second-brain logger with memory, patterns, and reset protocols
- Created tools that track **mood, stability, spending, and crash prediction**
- Built local-first apps with Gemini Nano, SQLite, FAISS, and RoomDB
- Mix execution speed with brutal clarity — no fluff, just systems that work

---

## 🔧 Currently Working On

- **SAM v2**: A self-tracking engine with insights, expenses, and emotional data as first-class citizens
- **Code With Utility**: Weekly drop of *real code, real use*, no gimmicks ([#CodeWithUtility](https://twitter.com/ravimishra07))
- **YouTube AI Pipelines**: Faceless script + voiceover generation (CreatorVoice)
- **Tutor App**: Real-world SaaS for offline tutors — Firebase, Compose, realtime logs

---

## 🧠 Stack (By Heart, Not Hype)

- **Mobile**: Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Coroutines, LiveData, SwiftUI
- **Data Layer**: RoomDB, Firebase Firestore, SQLite
- **AI Systems**: SentenceTransformers + FAISS, Gemini Nano (on-device), local LLMs
- **Dev Utilities**: GitHub automation, CLI journaling, structured JSONL logs

## 🤖 Not Just Code — Systems

I don't build apps.  
I build **mental prosthetics** — tools that catch you when emotion fails.  
Code is just the skin. The soul is survival.
